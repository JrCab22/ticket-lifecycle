You can add an internal note to allow for more organization that we know which agent is addressing which ticket. This helps with tickets involving multiple team members.


**Stage 3: Working the issue**
- Always make sure to keep in frequent contact providing updates to the end user along with other staff members if they are working on the same ticket as you. Be professional!



**Stage 4: Resolution**
- Only close the ticket when we have confirmation that the end user's issue was resolved.
