<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

- As either Ken or Karen we will sign into the Support Center to put in a request: http://localhost/osTicket/

- Next we will sign in as Isabella a Help Desk agent to practice the resolving the tickets. This is the link for Agent or Admin login http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php.
- We will choose which ticket to work on based on priority. Make sure to read them carefully!

- We are able to assign the tickets to other team members, but since we are able to resolve it ourselves we assign it to us.
- We can also change the SLA plan depending on the impact. In this case it's SEV C for a password reset.

**Stage 2: Assignment and communication**
- We will respond to the customer in a warm polite manner and let them know how we will assist them.

- If needing to assign to another member of the team show courtesty in your written message that will transfer the ticket to them.

  
In this instance with the mobile banking issue, I will refer the ticket to Winston who is on the Level 2 Support team:

**Stage 3: Working the issue**
- Always make sure to keep in frequent contact providing updates to the end user along with other staff members if they are working on the same ticket as you. Be professional!

**Stage 4: Resolution**
- Ask the customer if there is anything else we can assist them with.
- Only close the ticket when we have confirmation that the end user's issue was resolved.
